HW2 PROB 5 SHYAMAL ANADKAT
==============================================================================

a) Does it use a SPI, I2C, or UART interface?

> It has a selectable SPI/I2C with the main processor. There is a dedicated auxiliary SPI and flexibility for te primary interace - I2C/SPI.

b) Does the gyro output angular position, or angular rate? 

> Angular rate data

c) If we wanted an output data rate around 400 readings per second does it support that? 

> yes, the closest it supports is around 416 readings per second, or 416 Hz of data rate. 

d) How would we synchronize our Verilog with itâ€¦how would we know it has a new set of measurements ready for us?

> Using the accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready signal : Gyroscope data-ready on INT1 pad.
We can create verilog block that waits for this interrupt signal to go high.
And then move on to next control state of the state machine.
